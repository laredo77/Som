# Som

The SOM (Self-organizing map) is using a network of 61 neurons that mapping election votes by locality in Israel.
The Elec_24.csv file contains data on the localities, the economic status of the locality and the number of votes for each party in the 24th Israeli Knesset elections.
Through the SOM network, localities were mapped and their votes were distributed, thus linking the localities and their economic status to the selection
of their elected representatives.

The Result:
Clustering of localitiees with the same distribution of votes for parties and presenting them on the map and how the economic status affects it.
In the map the green areas is the localities that are high-economic status voting to similar parties as well as low-ecinomic localities (in red) voting to similar parties.
